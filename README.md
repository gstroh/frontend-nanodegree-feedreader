## Feed Reader Testing Project

The purpose of this project is to create a Jasmine test environment for an RSS feed reader application by applying the techniques I've picked up in Udacity's [Javascript Testing course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud549).

To get started, check out the repository to inspect the code:

* [Github code repository](https://github.com/gstroh/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader)
* To start the application locally, run this file: index.html

#### Reference

* [Jasmine Documentation](http://jasmine.github.io/2.1/introduction.html)

#### How to run this locally

* Click "Download Zip" while viewing the Github code repository (link above).
* Double click on the downloaded folder.
* Double click on index.html to open the application in your favorite browser.
